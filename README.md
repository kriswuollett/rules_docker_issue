Verify python3 app works:

```console

See that python3 image does not work:

```console
$ docker exec -it --env NAME=$USER rules_docker_issue /usr/local/bin/bazel run //:hello_name_py_image
ERROR: While resolving toolchains for target //:hello_name_py_image.binary: No matching toolchains found for types @bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain_type. Maybe --incompatible_use_cc_configure_from_rules_cc has been flipped and there is no default C++ toolchain added in the WORKSPACE file? See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10134 for details and migration instructions.
